#FamousCube

# Mobile

The Cordova project is located in the cube directory.
You must have Cordova installed on your system to work with the mobile clients.
The cordova-app directory was created with the following command:
```
$ cordova create cordova-app "com.rezdy.mobile" "Rezdy" --link-to ./app // This pulls everything from the app directory into the cordova-app mobile diorectory
$ cordova platform add ios/android
$ ionic resources // this will create all the splash screens andicons from the resources directory.  The sizes for the master images should be: splashscreen (2208x2208px) and icons (192x192px).

```
To build the pojects, you can run:
```
$ cordova build ios/android
```

To deploy the ios app, you will need an Apple Develoeprs license and credetials, and open the /cordova-app/platforms/Rezdy.xcodproj in Xcode and run from there.
To deploy the Android client, run
```
$ cordova build androd --release
```
You must have debug properties set in an ant.properties file in the cordova-app directory with the contents:
```
key.store=/Users/tim/.android/debug.keystore
key.store.password=android
key.alias=androiddebugkey
key.alias.password=android
```
You can then copy the .apk file from the ant build directory to a device for testing.


```
$ cordova build ios/android
```

##Dependencies
node.js [the installer](http://nodejs.org/download) found on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).
grunt-cli
bower
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

##Getting Started

```
npm install && bower install
```

##Running the Development Server

```
$ serve
```

http://localhost:3000/app/

Other methods
Simply run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open Chrome.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.

You can run serve with ```--port=9001``` to manually pick the port that the server will run on

*This option is currently borked...*
You can also change the port livereload is running on with the option ```--livereload=8675309```
*... if you think you can fix it check out the [issue on github](https://github.com/Famous/generator-famous/issues/22)*

If you would like to have your server be accessible to other devices on your local machine use the option ```--hostname=0.0.0.0```

##Production

If you would like to compile your project for distribution simply run the command ```grunt``` to build ```dist/``` which will be a deployment ready version of your app.  Preprocessing will be applied to html, all js will be concatenated and minified.  All js / css assets will also have their name prepended with a hash for cache busting.

##Why are styles so strict?

While the default style guidelines are fairly strict, we are doing so with reason.  Famo.us is not only a framework for creating cutting edge web application, but a community project that we are all going to contribute to in the hopes of making the web better.  We truly believe that having consistent style within the community will make it easier for individuals to jump between different Famo.us modules without having to waste valuable time on processing style.

While our Package Manager (which is currently in development) will enforce our style guide if you would like to publish a module, feel free to disable eslint or jscs as you see fit.  If you want to disable linting you will need to comment out lines 18 - 19 in ```grunt/aliases.js```
